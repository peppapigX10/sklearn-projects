## About
This repo contains many machine learning projects built with scikit-learn demonstrating various surpervised learning techniques like classification and regression models.

## Projects

### 1. CasteSystem
A classification model based on the book by Adolf Huxley *Brave New World*. This model predicts which caste a person belongs to based on intelligence and other metrics.

### 2. Hand Cream Analysis
Classification model to determine price based on information regarding hand cream products like company and product name.

### 3. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
Exploring and implementing K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to determine a patient's label (healthy, cancer, diabetes, heart disease) based on information like blood pressure etc...

### 4. Logistic Regression
Binary classification using logistic regression to determine if a student fails or passes with information like study hours per week.

### 5. Naive Bayes
Using Naive Bayes theorem to classify the probability a review is negative or positive.

### 6. Random Forest
Using random forest classifier to classify a patient's disorder based on information like social withdrawal.

## 7. Cognitive Distortions Classifier (proj1_CogDistortions)
Sklearn project to identify cognitive distortions in text

## Installation

Most projects just train the data and output accuracy. Only caste system is interactive

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/peppapigX10/sklearn-projects.git
cd sklearn-projects
```
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib --break-system-packages
```

## Interactive-project
CasteSystem project is **interactive* it asks you questions to determine your caste in the system created by Adolf Huxley. Follow the prompts and the model will predict your caste based on your answers.

```bash
cd CasteSystem
python main.py
```
